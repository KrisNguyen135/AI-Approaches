# Artificial Intelligence Approaches in Classic Games
 Implementing AI ideas and models in the adversarial context of games such as
 Nim, Snake, or even Flappy Birds
 
 ## Hard-coded logic/algorithms
 Games: Nim, Minesweeper (combined with a probabilistic approach)
 
 ## Path-finding algorithms
 Algorithms:
 - Depth-first, breadth-first, best-first
 - Minimax
 - Dijkstra
 - A*
 
 Games: Sudoku, Tic Tac Toe, Maze
 
 ## Genetic algorithm
 Games: Optimization of polynomials, Jigsaw
 
 ## Reinforcement learning
 Games: Snake
 
 ## NEAT
 (Includes an explanation of neural networks)
 
 Games: Flappy Birds, Pacman
 
 ## Deep reinforcement learning
 Games: **Pending**
