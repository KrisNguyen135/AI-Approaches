# Artificial Intelligence Approaches in Classic Games
 Implementing AI ideas and models in the adversarial context of games such as
 Nim, Snake, or even Flappy Birds
 
 ## Hard-coded logic/algorithms
 Games: [Nim](https://github.com/KrisNguyen135/AI-Approaches/tree/master/HardCoded/Nim),
 [Minesweeper](https://github.com/KrisNguyen135/AI-Approaches/tree/master/HardCoded/MineSweeper)
 
 ## Path-finding algorithms
 Algorithms:
 - Depth-first, breadth-first, best-first
 - Minimax + Alpha-Beta pruning
 - Dijkstra
 - A and A*
 
 Games: Sudoku, Tic Tac Toe, Maze
 - To mention: River-crossing, Chess
 
 ## Genetic algorithm
 Games: Optimization of polynomials, Jigsaw
 
 ## Reinforcement learning
 (Includes Q-learning)
 
 Games: Nim (revisited), Snake
 
 ## Machine learning & Deep learning
 Games: Nim (revisited) (ML), Minesweeper (revisited) (DL)
 
 ## NEAT
 (Includes an explanation of neural networks)
 
 Games: [Flappy Birds](https://github.com/KrisNguyen135/AI-Approaches/tree/master/NEAT/Flappy),
 Pacman, Chrome T-Rex
 
 ## Deep reinforcement learning
 Games: **Pending**
